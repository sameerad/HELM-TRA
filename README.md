    Sample (Refabricated) dataset for tax risk modeling

    Usage instructions and system requirements

🔐 Note on Data Privacy

To comply with national regulations and ensure non-disclosure of confidential information from the Iranian government, the dataset used in this project is refabricated and anonymized. While it preserves key statistical properties (normality, skewness, feature distributions, etc.), it does not contain real taxpayer records. The dataset is synthetic and intended for research and demonstration purposes only.
